Supplementary Figures and Tables for k-Optimization Paper

File contains results of simulation analyses, comparing feature selection algorithms for their ability to detect interactions and main effects. Data with balanced (equal case/control) and imbalanced (unequal case/control) is tested. There are also results of pathway analysis using real RNA-Seq data from a study of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
